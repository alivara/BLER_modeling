# Thesis Work
This code has written in python programming language for thesis work with professor Ruberto Bruschi, and all the functions have been labelled.

## Fit Surface
This code will find the Best Fit on the Data by using least squares and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm method, which i will present in the next meeting, because I need time to calibrate the code base on the data
