# Jason Files
These are the jason file which has been used in the code as input data.
  ls: Length of Location
  ws: Width of Location
  x: X axis of gNodeB
  y: Y axis of gNodeB
  n: number of UEs
  p: payload

In this data we just have 2500 BLER for each dataset which means in each 0.5*0.5 we have two UEs and the locations are 0-100 which means for calibration we need to change the scale to 0-50, which I have done in the code.
